# Dobot Magician with CNN for Assembly Tasks

## Project Overview

This project integrates computer vision and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to transform an academic robot into an efficient assembly system in a laboratory production plant. The goal is to validate an industrial production chain. It incorporates the YOLOV3 algorithm, trained using the Darknet framework and OpenCV for calculating real-world coordinates from image coordinates.

Initially, the robot was trained to identify 1-cubic-inch cubes of red or blue color.

## API and Main Script

The `main_api.py` file creates an API using FASTAPI, which communicates with the main algorithm contained within the `Dobot_full.py` script. Other scripts are used for calibrating distances and will be explained as the project progresses.

Feel free to contribute to this project.
